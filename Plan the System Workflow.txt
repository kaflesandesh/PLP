1. Plan the System Workflow
Core Idea:
The system will serve as a personalized educational platform for rural students, enabling interactive learning, tracking progress, and integrating modern technology (such as LLMs) to make education accessible and engaging.

System Workflow:
Authentication and User Management:

Students, instructors, and admins can log in or sign up.
Role-based access control:
Admin: System management (add/remove courses, assign roles).
Instructor: Upload course content, assignments, and provide feedback.
Student: Access learning materials, submit assignments, view feedback.
Course Management:

Instructors create courses and add learning materials.
Students enroll in courses and complete assignments.
Admin oversees course approvals and modifications.
Learning Materials:

Host PDFs, videos, quizzes, and interactive content.
Allow students to download and view resources offline.
Feedback and Progress:

Real-time tracking of student activity.
Feedback mechanism between students and instructors.
Generate personalized reports based on learning patterns.
System Utilities:

Bug reporting for technical issues.
Regular system maintenance and updates.
Integration of Free LLMs:

Provide an AI-powered chatbot for Q&A and tutoring.
Automated assignment grading using LLMs.
Generate summaries or additional learning resources based on course content.
2. Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Backend Development
Set Up Flask App:

Use the app.py as the central controller for routing.
Implement role-based authentication in login.py.
Database Schema (plp.db):

Create tables for users, courses, enrollments, materials, assignments, feedback, and progress.
Use SQLAlchemy or Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM.
Modules Development:

User Management:
Develop user.py, admin.py, instructor.py, and student.py for CRUD operations.
Ensure secure password handling (e.g., Flask-Bcrypt).
Course and Learning Materials:
Create methods in course.py for course creation, update, and delete.
Use learning-material.py to handle uploads (Flask-Uploads or Flask-S3 for cloud storage).
Assignments and Feedback:
Add assignment submission logic in assignment.py.
Track and log feedback interactions in feedback.py.
System Utilities:

Add system diagnostics, reporting, and bug management in system.py.
Phase 2: Frontend Development
Templates:

Design responsive HTML templates in the templates folder using Bootstrap.
Create separate dashboards for students, instructors, and admins.
Static Assets:

Use static/css for styling and static/script for interactive frontend features (e.g., JavaScript-based dynamic forms).
Integrate API Endpoints:

Build REST APIs in Flask for AJAX-based interactions between frontend and backend.
Phase 3: AI-Powered Features
LLM Integration:

Use open-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 alternatives like Hugging Face models or OpenAI's free-tier APIs).
Features:
Chatbot for student questions (integrate with a Flask route).
AI-based grading system:
Extract assignment answers from submissions and grade them using a text similarity metric.
Content summarization or generation:
Allow instructors to auto-generate quiz questions or summaries.
Model Deployment:

Host the LLM on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Hugging Face Spaces) for scalable API access.
Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
Testing:

Unit test individual modules (e.g., pytest for Python).
Perform integration testing for end-to-end workflows.
Collect beta user feedback (students and instructors in rural areas).
Deployment:

Host the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Heroku).
Use Nginx or Apache as the reverse proxy.
Ensure SSL for secure communication.
3. Example Workflow Implementation
User Login:
A student enters credentials → Authenticated in login.py → Redirected to the student dashboard.
Course Enrollment:
A student views a list of courses in their dashboard (handled by course.py) → Clicks enroll → Enrollment stored in the database.
Assignment Submission:
A student uploads a file for an assignment via assignment.py → File is stored in the system and marked as pending review.
Feedback:
Instructor reviews the assignment and provides feedback in feedback.py → Student views the feedback on their dashboard.
AI Assistance:
A student asks the AI chatbot a question → LLM processes the query → Returns a helpful response.
4. Future Enhancements
Add gamification features (badges, leaderboards).
Enable offline functionality with PWA (Progressive Web App) support.
Introduce live virtual classrooms with video conferencing APIs (e.g., WebRTC or Zoom SDK).
